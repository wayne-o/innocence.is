## Technical Architecture

### ZK Proof Stack
```
SP1 Circuits (Rust)
â”œâ”€â”€ Core Proofs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ownership_proof.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ balance_proof.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trade_proof.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ compliance_proof.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ Aggregation Layer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ batch_verifier.rs
â””â”€â”€ Helper Circuits
    â”œâ”€â”€ merkle_proof.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ range_proof.rs
    â””â”€â”€ signature_proof.rs
```

### Proof Generation Flow
1. User initiates action (withdraw/trade)
2. Frontend generates witness data
3. SP1 prover creates proof
4. Proof submitted to smart contract
5. On-chain verification
6. Action executed if valid

## MVP Definition

**Required features for launch:**
1. Full ZK proof system for ALL operations
2. Private deposits with compliance proofs âœ…
3. Private withdrawals with nullifier proofs
4. Private spot trading with balance proofs
5. Private perps trading with position proofs
6. Complete proof verification on-chain
7. 10+ TPS throughput capability

**Performance Targets:**
- Proof generation: <30 seconds
- Verification gas: <500k
- Anonymity set: >100 users
- Circuit security: 128-bit

## Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Build complete SP1 circuit suite
- **Week 3**: Integrate proof generation in frontend
- **Week 4**: Implement withdrawal and trading with ZK
- **Week 5**: Advanced privacy features
- **Week 6**: Security audit and optimization
