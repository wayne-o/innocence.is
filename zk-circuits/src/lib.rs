// Placeholder for SP1 ZK circuit implementations
// 
// In a production implementation, this would contain:
// 1. Ownership proof circuit - proves ownership of a commitment
// 2. Withdrawal proof circuit - proves right to withdraw without linking to deposit
// 3. Certificate verification circuit - proves compliance without revealing personal data
//
// Each circuit would be implemented as a separate SP1 program that can be
// compiled and deployed for on-chain verification.
//
// Example structure:
// - src/ownership/main.rs - Ownership proof program
// - src/withdrawal/main.rs - Withdrawal proof program  
// - src/certificate/main.rs - Certificate verification program
//
// The circuits would use SP1's zkVM to prove statements about:
// - Merkle tree membership
// - Hash preimages
// - Signature verification
// - Range proofs
//
// Integration with the smart contracts would involve:
// 1. Generating proofs client-side using SP1 SDK
// 2. Submitting proofs to the smart contract
// 3. Verifying proofs on-chain using SP1 verifier contracts
//
// For MVP development, the smart contracts accept placeholder proofs
// to allow testing the full system flow without requiring the full
// SP1 setup initially.
