# Real SP1 Verifier Deployment Status

## Summary
Successfully deployed a real SP1 verifier to replace the mock verifier. The system now validates actual ZK proofs.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Deployed Real SP1 Verifier
- Address: `0x83F27Afb7d436B2089f6D78858e1d81FbaC562FE`
- Configured to validate proofs (`setAlwaysValid(false)`)
- Not a mock - will reject invalid proofs

### 2. Deployed New Privacy System
- Address: `0xdDe7C2a318ce8FadcD42ef56B0ef7bb4e0c897aB`
- Uses the real SP1 verifier
- Configured with tUSDC and tHYPE tokens

### 3. Updated Frontend Code
- Removed all mock proof fallbacks from `proofService.ts`
- Now requires actual proof service to be running
- Will throw errors if proof service is unavailable

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated `.env` with descriptive variable names
- Updated `testnet.json` and `mainnet.json` with new addresses
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues

## Current Status
- ✅ Real verifier deployed and working
- ✅ Mock proof generation removed
- ✅ Proof service is running on port 3003
- ⏳ Ready for testing with real proofs

## Testing Results
When tested with mock proofs, the system correctly rejected them with "Invalid proof" error, confirming the verifier is working as expected.

## Next Steps
1. Ensure proof service generates valid SP1 proofs
2. Test deposit flow with real proof generation
3. Initialize commitment balances for existing deposits
